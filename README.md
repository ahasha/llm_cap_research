# LLM Climate Action Planning Research Assistant

The goal of this project is to extract a structured table of goals and action items from human-readable Climate Action Plans
published as PDF documents.

As a member of Milton's [Climate Action Planning Committee](https://www.townofmilton.org/584/Climate-Action-Planning-Committee), I'm working with ten other committed, passionate volunteers, town staff, and stakeholders throughout the community to develop a roadmp to reduce Milton's town-wide greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050.
